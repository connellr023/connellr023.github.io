    to build RESTful APIs and web applications. It is designed to be very lightweight
    and easy to use. The main reason I created it was because I wanted to use PHP
    to create a web app but I did not want to use a bloated framework like Laravel.
    Secondly, I wanted to refresh my knowledge of PHP and learn how to create a framework.
    However, after creating it, I never ended up using it because I don&#39;t have the
    love for PHP that I used to when it was the only web language I knew.`,I,p,N="features",k,b,V=`Detailed documentation is available on the <b>GitHub</b> repository. I will list
    some of the features here:`,L,h,E=`<i>Middlewares</i> are classes that can be used to modify the request and response
    objects before the controller is called.`,j,m,B=`<i>Controllers</i> are classes that are used to handle HTTP requests and echo
    a response.`,$,v,F=`<i>Models</i> are classes that are used to interact with the database. They can
    hook into a global database object that is essentially a PDO wrapper. Models
    were more loosely implemented than controllers and middlewares as they were not
    required to be used.`,q,w,J=`<i>View</i> in this framework is a single directory containing static files to
    be served as a single page application generated by a frontend framework. This
    part is also optional.`,R,_,K="routing",S,x,Q=`Routing is done by a <i>Router</i> class that could match URI Regex patterns
    and request methods to controllers. Middlewares and controllers are
    registered to the router and the router calls the middleware before the
    controller. An interesting optimization I made was to seperate static routes
    from dynamic routes. That is, routes registered with a static URI could be
    mapped in <b>O(1)</b> time while dynamic routes would be mapped in
    <b>O(n)</b> time.`,O,H,W="testing",z,P,X=`The framework includes comprehensive unit and integration tests including
    all the features of the framework. The tests were written using <b>PHPUnit</b>
    and are run in a <b>GitHub Actions</b> workflow.`,A,C,Y="final_note",U,y,Z=`I honestly think PHP is an underrated language and should be learned before
    diving into Node.js. It gave me such a foundational understanding of HTTP
    and web development that is abstracted away in Node.js with its vast
    ecosystem of libraries.`,D,T,ee=`I would recommend this framework to anyone who is looking to learn how to
    create a web framework or wants to create a simple web app in PHP. I cannot
    vet how production ready it is because I never used it in production... but
    it should be fine.`;return{c(){n=i("h2"),n.textContent=g,l=d(),f=i("p"),f.innerHTML=M,I=d(),p=i("h2"),p.textContent=N,k=d(),b=i("p"),b.innerHTML=V,L=d(),h=i("p"),h.innerHTML=E,j=d(),m=i("p"),m.innerHTML=B,$=d(),v=i("p"),v.innerHTML=F,q=d(),w=i("p"),w.innerHTML=J,R=d(),_=i("h2"),_.textContent=K,S=d(),x=i("p"),x.innerHTML=Q,O=d(),H=i("h2"),H.textContent=W,z=d(),P=i("p"),P.innerHTML=X,A=d(),C=i("h2"),C.textContent=Y,U=d(),y=i("p"),y.textContent=Z,D=d(),T=i("p"),T.textContent=ee,this.h()},l(e){n=r(e,"H2",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(n)!=="svelte-mht1ex"&&(n.textContent=g),l=c(e),f=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(f)!=="svelte-riv3hy"&&(f.innerHTML=M),I=c(e),p=r(e,"H2",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(p)!=="svelte-1cun1nt"&&(p.textContent=N),k=c(e),b=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(b)!=="svelte-mbl1nv"&&(b.innerHTML=V),L=c(e),h=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(h)!=="svelte-10qg42f"&&(h.innerHTML=E),j=c(e),m=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(m)!=="svelte-1govun7"&&(m.innerHTML=B),$=c(e),v=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(v)!=="svelte-1mvhnij"&&(v.innerHTML=F),q=c(e),w=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(w)!=="svelte-jiiwza"&&(w.innerHTML=J),R=c(e),_=r(e,"H2",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(_)!=="svelte-1p027da"&&(_.textContent=K),S=c(e),x=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(x)!=="svelte-sy2oxh"&&(x.innerHTML=Q),O=c(e),H=r(e,"H2",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(H)!=="svelte-199fv38"&&(H.textContent=W),z=c(e),P=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(P)!=="svelte-oo4cap"&&(P.innerHTML=X),A=c(e),C=r(e,"H2",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(C)!=="svelte-y3jckb"&&(C.textContent=Y),U=c(e),y=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(y)!=="svelte-16295za"&&(y.textContent=Z),D=c(e),T=r(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),o(T)!=="svelte-lv2348"&&(T.textContent=ee),this.h()},h(){u(n,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(f,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(p,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(b,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(h,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(m,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(v,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(w,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(_,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(x,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(H,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(P,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(C,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(y,"class","left-bar fade-in"),u(T,"class","left-bar fade-in")},m(e,t){a(e,n,t),a(e,l,t),a(e,f,t),a(e,I,t),a(e,p,t),a(e,k,t),a(e,b,t),a(e,L,t),a(e,h,t),a(e,j,t),a(e,m,t),a(e,$,t),a(e,v,t),a(e,q,t),a(e,w,t),a(e,R,t),a(e,_,t),a(e,S,t),a(e,x,t),a(e,O,t),a(e,H,t),a(e,z,t),a(e,P,t),a(e,A,t),a(e,C,t),a(e,U,t),a(e,y,t),a(e,D,t),a(e,T,t)},p:ae,d(e){e&&(s(n),s(l),s(f),s(I),s(p),s(k),s(b),s(L),s(h),s(j),s(m),s($),s(v),s(q),s(w),s(R),s(_),s(S),s(x),s(O),s(H),s(z),s(P),s(A),s(C),s(U),s(y),s(D),s(T))}}}function be(G){let n,g;return n=new ce({props:{title:"gratis",category:"learning_projects",repository:["connellr023/gratis","https://github.com/connellr023/gratis"],$$slots:{default:[pe]},$$scope:{ctx:G}}}),{c(){le(n.$$.fragment)},l(l){ie(n.$$.fragment,l)},m(l,f){re(n,l,f),g=!0},p(l,[f]){const M={};f&1&&(M.$$scope={dirty:f,ctx:l}),n.$set(M)},i(l){g||(oe(n.$$.fragment,l),g=!0)},o(l){ue(n.$$.fragment,l),g=!1},d(l){de(n,l)}}}class xe extends se{constructor(n){super(),ne(this,n,null,be,te,{})}}export{xe as component,_e as universal};
