    how it was implemented in Gleam.`,G,x,B=`What is interesting about this approach, is that the webserver can scale to
    handle many users at once because of the way the Erlang VM handles
    concurrency. This is in contrast to single-threaded servers like those in
    Node.js which will hit a limit on the number of users they can handle at
    some point.`,q,_,J="challenges",R,C,K=`The concept of socket programming was not new to me at this point but I

    help of a small library called <b>mist</b>.`,S,w,Q=`This was difficult at first because Gleam is a new language and the
    documentation is not as extensive as other languages. Additionally, at the
    time of writing this, <b>mist</b> had almost no documentation on how to use sockets
